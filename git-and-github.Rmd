# git vocabulary

pull
: Receive changes (edits, new files, files removed).

push
: Send changes to another computer.

clone
: Download an existing repo, e.g. from github.com. "The first pull."

repo
: Folder of files to track, with a ".git/" database of revisions.

# git vocabulary

add
: Mark a changed file as ready to commit. Moves an edit to the staging area.

staging
: A waiting area for edits before they are commited.

commit
: Bundle edits together. Needs a commit message. Moves edits from the staging area into 
  the .git/ database. A commit is the standard unit of time in git.

checkout
: Update the files in your working directory to what they were at a particular commit.

# Vocabulary

push
: Send new commits in my .git/ database to a different computer (like
  github.com).
  
If the .git/ database on the other computer has different commits, the push is aborted.

pull
: Receive new commits to my .git/ database.

If the .git/ database on the other computer has different commits, git will try to merge those changes, but if there is a merge conflict, you must throw away your computer.

# Why learn git?

"Move fast and break things" mentality.  
Multiple versions of files without having multiple files.  
Reproducibility.  
Open science.

# Brace yourselves!
