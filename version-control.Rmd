# Why learn git?

"Move fast and break things" mentality.  
Multiple versions of files without having multiple files.  
Reproducibility.  
Open science.

# Verify that git is installed and configured

Open a terminal and type the following commands to verify that
your installation of git is installed and configured properly.

```bash
git config --help  # read some of the help text
git config --list  # list the configured variables
```

You should see your `user.name` and `user.email` in the output. If not,
follow the steps in this video[^get_going].

[^get_going]: [git-scm.com/video/get-going](https://git-scm.com/video/get-going)

# Configuring `git`

* The only required steps are to define a `user.name` and `user.email`.
* The "git user" is the author of the changes you make.

\vspace{1em}

**Why don't you need to define a `user.password` configuration variable to use
`git`?**

# Configure `git` to use a text editor

When using `git`, you will need a text editor to write commit messages.

You should learn how to use a command line text editor like nano or vim, or
download a text editor that `git` can be configured to work with.

```bash
# configure git to use the text editor "atom"
git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"
```

\small See this help article[^text_editors] for instructions on how to configure `git` to use other common text editors like Sublime, TextMate, and Notepad++.

# Create a new git repo

Move to the Desktop or any place you'd like to create a new git repo.
You will delete it at the end of this section.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/
git init proj1  # start a new repo named "proj1"
ls proj1        # why was nothing created?
rmdir proj1     # why is the directory not empty?
ls -la proj1    # what was created?
```

# What's inside the ".git" directory?

If you are lucky, you will never have to poke around in here.

\small

```
proj1/.git
├── HEAD
├── config
├── description
├── hooks
│   └── (11 files, sample hooks)
├── info
│   └── exclude
├── objects
│   ├── info
│   └── pack
└── refs
    ├── heads
    └── tags
```

# Running `git status`

`git status` will be one of your most used commands.

The presence of a valid ".git" directory is how git knows to watch the contents
of this directory for changes.

Run the `git status` command from outside and inside the "proj1" directory and
observe the differences.

```bash
cd ..        # move outside the proj1 directory
git status   # try to git status outside a repo
cd proj1     # move in the repo
git status   # check the status of an empty repo
```

# Your first commit

Create an empty text file in the proj1 directory.

```bash
touch first-file.txt  # create an empty file
git status            # run this command after each step
```

Follow the steps described in the output of the git status command
to include the new file "first-file.txt" in what will be committed:

```bash
git add first-file.txt
git status
```

# Writing a commit message

Create a commit by entering a commit message:

```bash
git commit  # opens an editor to write the commit message
```

Note that `git` will wait in the terminal until you write a commit message,
save, and close the file.

# Writing a commit message from the command line

* Alternately, you can enter the commit message from the command line.
* Best for small changes that can be described in a few words.
* To describe larger changes you will want to use a text editor.

\vspace{1em}

```bash
git commit -m "Added an empty text file"
```

\vspace{1em}

**All commits must have messages. This is a fundamental difference between
"committing" and "saving".**

# Viewing the commit history

After creating your first commit, run the following commands, and
try to understand the output.

\vspace{1em}

```bash
git status
git log
git log --oneline
```

# Starting a second commit

Create two more empty files to commit to the repo.

\vspace{1em}

```bash
touch second-file.txt third-file.txt
```

\vspace{1em}

Continue to run `git status` after each step to verify what is going on.

# Methods for adding files

Add the files using one of the following methods:

```bash
# Method 1
git add second-file.txt
git add third-file.txt

# Method 2
git add second-file.txt third-file.txt

# Method 3
git add *-file.txt

# Method 4
git add .
```

# Unstaging changes you do not want to commit

Use `git reset` to move changes back and forth between the
Working Directory and the Staging Area.

```bash
git reset second-file.txt
git status
git add second-file.txt
git status
```

You will most often need this when you run `git add .` and realize you added
something you did not want to.

# Authoring the second commit

Commit the two new files to the repo:

```bash
git status  # make sure the two files are staged
git commit -m "Add two new empty files"
git status
git log
```

# Deleting a file

To delete a file from a git repo, you need to mark it as purposefully
removed with `git rm [file]`.

```bash
rm second-file.txt     # remove the file
git status
git rm second-file.txt # mark as purposefully removed
git status
git commit -m "Removed the second file"
git log
git log --oneline
```

\small You don't have to run both `rm [file]` and `git rm [file]`.  
`git rm [file]` will remove the file too, if it exists.

# `git` areas

Once a change is committed to the git database, it is considered permanent.  
It is possible to undue things that are permanent, but it's harder.

# Go back in time

With `git` we can always roll back time to whatever commit we want.

\vspace{1em}

```bash
git log --oneline
# copy the SHA of the commit with the message:
# "Add two new empty files"
git checkout [SHA]  # roll back to that commit
ls  # notice the deleted file "second-file.txt"
git log
git checkout master  # go back to present
ls  # notice "second-file.txt" has been deleted
git log
```

# Get a file you once deleted

Using the same SHA from the previous step, provide
an additional argument to `git checkout` to retrieve
a file you once deleted.

\vspace{1em}

```bash
git checkout [SHA] second-file.txt
git status
git commit -m "Revived second file"
```

# Creating a presentation

Remove all empty files and create a new one for a presentation.

```bash
git rm *-file.txt
git commit -m "Removed all empty files"
touch presentation.Rmd
```

# Rmarkdown presentation

Create a simple Rmarkdown presentation file with the following
contents. **Note:** Replace the quotes with backticks.

```
---
title: Detecting changes in change detection detection
output: beamer_presentation
---
'''{r config, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
'''
```

Add the presentation to the repo.

```bash
git add presentation.Rmd
git commit -m "Add the title slide for the presentation"
```

# Compile the Rmarkdown presentation

Compile the presentation by opening it in RStudio and pressing "knit", or
running the following R command:

```bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('presentation.Rmd')"
```

You should see a new file, "presentation.pdf". Open it to see your presentation.

```bash
git status
open presentation.pdf
```

# Files to ignore

We want `git` to keep track of changes to "presentation.Rmd" but we
don't want it to keep track of changes to pdfs, like "presentation.pdf".

To ignore files, add them to a new file called ".gitignore" with the following
contents:

```
# contents of .gitignore
*.pdf
```

Then commit the new file .gitignore to the repo.

```bash
git status  # what happened to presentation.pdf?
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore pdfs"
```

# Add an exception

To add an exception to the rule, for example, to save a published version of
the pdf, you can force git to add the file, or add an exception to the
.gitignore.

```bash
mkdir talks
cp presentation.pdf talks/CogSci20.pdf

# Method 1: Force git to track the file
git add -f talks/CogSci18.pdf

# Method 2: Add an exception to the .gitignore
# for any pdfs in "talks/"
echo "!talks/*.pdf" >> .gitignore

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Add slides for talk given at CogSci20"
```

# Tracking changes to files

Add a new slide to the presentation. Remember to use backticks instead of quotes.

```
# Results

'''{r reaction-times}
m <- 0.06
b <- 2.1
df <- tibble(
  x = 1:100,
  y = m * x + b + runif(100)
)
ggplot(df) +
  aes(x, y) +
  geom_point()
'''
```

# Reviewing differences

Run `git diff` to view the changes you made to "presentation.Rmd"

```bash
git status
git diff
git add presentation.Rmd
git status
git diff
git diff --cached
```

# Commit the new slide

```bash
git add presentation.Rmd
git commit -m "Add results slide"
git log --oneline
```

# Compile the presentation again

Now that our presentation has chunks that are cached and generated figures,
we have additional files to ignore.

```bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('presentation.Rmd')"
git status
echo "*_cache/" >> .gitignore
echo "*_files/" >> .gitignore
git status
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore cache and output files for Rmd"
```

# Creating a new branch

**Branches are great! Use them.**

* Branches are bifurcations in the change history of a project.
* The default branch name is named "master" branch by convention.
* To switch branches, you will use the `git checkout` command.

Create a new branch and switch to it.

```bash
git status  # Note the first line of the output
git branch
git branch --help
git branch new-intro
git status  # Still on master...
git checkout new-intro
git status
```

# Shortcuts

To create a new branch and switch to it in one command, run the following:

```bash
git checkout --help  # read about the "-b" flag
git checkout -b new-intro
```

# Working on the new intro

Edit presentation.Rmd to add a new intro slide.

```
# Intro

How many changes does it take
to change a change detector's
change detection rate?
```

Add the change. Note the shortcut `git commit -am ...` which is short for `git add . && git commit -m ...`

```bash
git status  # should see change to presentation
git commit -am "Add a motivating question"
```

# Merging

* Eventually you will want your branches to converge.
* Technically, one branch will merge with another one.
* Order matters! Merging branches A into B may produce
  different results than merging B into A.
* In many cases, git handles merge conflicts intelligently.
* In the worst case, you have to handle a merge yourself.

# Simulating a merge

```bash
git status  # On branch new-intro
```

Edit the results plot on the new-intro branch.

```R
ggplot(df) +
  aes(x, y, size = error) +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE,
              show.legend = FALSE)
```

\vspace{1em}

Commit the changes to the plot.

```bash
git diff
git commit -am "Scale points by error and add regression line"
```

# Add changes on the master branch

```bash
git checkout master
```

Edit presentation.Rmd to adjust the plot,
simulating the merge conflict.

```R
ggplot(df) +
  aes(x, y) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE,
              show.legend = FALSE)
```

# Add a conclusion slide

While still on the master branch, also add a Conclusion slide
that is independent of the plot.

```
# Conclusion

It takes 100 changes to
change a change detector's
change detection rate!
```

\vspace{1em}

Commit the changes on the master branch.

```bash
git status
git commit -am "Update the plot and add conclusion"
```

# Your first merge conflict

We are going to merge the master branch into the new-intro branch.

```bash
git checkout new-intro
git merge master
# Auto-merging presentation.Rmd
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in presentation.Rmd
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

Open the file in your text editor or RStudio and look at the file.

# Merge conflicts

You should see that git has made presentation.Rmd look like this:

```
ggplot(df) +
<<<<<<< HEAD
  aes(x, y, size = error) +
  geom_point(shape = 1) +
=======
  aes(x, y) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
>>>>>>> master
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE,
              show.legend = FALSE)
```

# Understanding the merge conflict

* `<<<<<<< HEAD` marks the start of a merge conflit
* HEAD is whatever branch you are on (in this case, "new-intro")
* `>>>>>>> [branch]` marks the end of a merge conflict, where
  `[branch]` is the name of the branch you are merging in.
* In this case, we are merging the master branch into the new-intro branch.

# Things `git` did automatically

* `git` did not care about the new intro or conclusion slides. It merged these
  parts automatically.
* `git` also didn't care about the `geom_smooth` call which was independently
  added on both branches.

# Aborting the merge

Run `git status` and figure out how to abort the merge.

After aborting the merge, merge from the other side.

```bash
git checkout master
git merge new-intro
```

Open presentation.Rmd and read the merge conflict. It should make sense to you now.

# Fix the conflict

Replace the conflict (including `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> new-intro`) with a merged version:

```
ggplot(df) +
  aes(x, y, size = error) +
  geom_point(shape = 1, alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE,
              show.legend = FALSE)
```

Mark the merge as completed.

```bash
git add presentation.Rmd
git commit  # note the different default message
git log
```

# Collaborating

To allow others to collaborate on a project, we can make the repo available on a site that allows
free hosting of repos, like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

To collaborate on someone else's project, use the `git clone ...` command:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
# clone the repo containing these slides
git clone https://github.com/pedmiston/git-and-github.git
cd git-and-github
open slides/version-control.pdf
```

**Why don't you need to provide a GitHub username or password to download
these materials?**

# Create a private repo and clone it

* Login to github.com, select "New repository" from the "+" menu.
* Give your repo a dummy name like "private-proj"
* Select the radio option to make the repo "Private"
* Check the box "Initialize this repository with a README".
* Select the button to "Create the repository"

Then clone the newly created repo to your computer.

\vspace{1em}

\small

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[private-proj].git
# now you should have to provide your GitHub credentials
cd [private-proj]
cat README.md
git status
```

# Creating an endpoint for your local repo

Now we will configure your existing proj1 to push to GitHub.

* Login to github.com, select "New repository" from the "+" menu.
* Give your repo a temporary name, like `proj1`.
* Select the radio option to make the repo Public.
* For the option "Initialize this repository with a README", note the question
  says "Skip this step if you’re importing an existing repository." Since we
  are importing an existing repository, you should not check this box.

# Pushing your repo to GitHub

After creating the repo, follow the steps for "push an existing repository from the command line" on
the newly created repo page.
  
\vspace{1em}

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/proj1
git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/proj1.git
git push -u origin master
```

\vspace{1em}

After running the `git push ...` command from the terminal, refresh the page, and you should see your repo online for someone to clone.
